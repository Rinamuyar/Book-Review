# How the website looks like


## Home
There is four-part of the website that are separated into four pages:
Home page, books page, movies page, and general page.
On the home page, I made a simple and explicit design with 
Short text and image. Below the text, there is a button that will lead to signing up page, which the users will require to add some of their information 
Before using the website

## Books
The next page is the “books page”; On this page, books are listed with four categories depending on the types of books. By clicking the first box with the “romance novel” title. There would be book reviews available for popular romance novel books. And same goes for the remaining categories.

## movies
The third page is a movies review page, which is also listed by four main categories: Comedy, Horror, Drama, and Anime. The idea of listing these books with categories is for the users to be able to choose their favorite categories quickly. In each category, there are relevant books listed with their names. By clicking on the book, you can read the details about the book as well as the review.

## General
As a final page, there are all the details about this website including the contact information.
